/*1. You are given a text file, named “students.txt” that contains students’ records. Each Line
contains information of a single student in the form of <Student Name, Roll No,
Department>.
A. Read the records from the file into an array of structures.
B. Three Options will turn up: (1) Bubble Sort, (2) Binary Search, and (3) Quit. In the
following we describe what your C/C++ program will do on Selecting the options.
(1) Bubble Sort: Sorts the records based on Student Name. If more than One students has
the same name, then sort them on their roll no.
(2) Binary Search: Given a student name, the function will return all the Student records
<Student Name, Roll No, Department>*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void BubbleSort(struct student *arr, int n){
    
}
void BinarySearch(struct student *arr, char *name, int n){
    
}
